# Langchain-Personal-Assistant

This repo is used for my personal project of understanding LangChain Memory.

I want to build a Personal Performance Assistant, who helps me be more productive by being my Project Manager.

## LangChain_Agent_Memory_Exploration Notebook
This notebook contains my first test with the different memory types. 

I think it will serve as a reference for future action.
